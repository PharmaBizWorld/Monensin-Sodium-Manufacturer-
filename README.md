What is Monensin Sodium?
Monensin Sodium is an ionophore antibiotic that plays a crucial role in enhancing feed efficiency and promoting animal health. Its unique mechanism involves altering ion transport across cell membranes, effectively managing microbial populations in the gastrointestinal tract. This results in:
Improved Feed Conversion Rates: Enabling livestock to gain more weight with less feed.
Reduced Risk of Coccidiosis: A common parasitic disease in poultry and livestock.
Enhanced Energy Utilization: Optimizing ruminal fermentation in cattle for better productivity.
With its proven efficacy, Monensin Sodium is a cornerstone of modern livestock management.
